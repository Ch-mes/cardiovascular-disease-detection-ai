# Cardiovascular Disease Detection Using AI

## Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on patient health parameters.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
- (Optional) Web-based prediction interface

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Flask / Streamlit (if applicable)

## Dataset
Public cardiovascular dataset used for research purposes.

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
